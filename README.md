## Introduction

Suno is an amazing AI music service. Although the official API is not yet available, we couldn't wait to integrate its capabilities somewhere.

We discovered that some users have similar needs, so we decided to open-source this project, hoping you'll like it.

This implementation uses the paid [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/about) service (a.k.a. ruCaptcha) to solve the hCaptcha challenges automatically and does not use any already made closed-source paid Suno API implementations.

## Demo

We have deployed an example bound to a free Suno account, so it has daily usage limits, but you can see how it runs:
[suno.gcui.ai](https://suno.gcui.ai)

## Features

- Perfectly implements the creation API from suno.ai.
- Automatically keep the account active.
- Solve CAPTCHAs automatically using [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) with [rebrowser-patches](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-patches).
- Compatible with the format of OpenAIâ€™s `/v1/chat/completions` API.
- Supports Custom Mode.
- One-click deployment to [Vercel](#deploy-to-vercel) & [Docker](#docker).
- In addition to the standard API, it also adapts to the API Schema of Agent platforms like GPTs and Coze, so you can use it as a tool/plugin/Action for LLMs and integrate it into any AI Agent.
- Permissive open-source license, allowing you to freely integrate and modify.

## Getting Started

### 1. Obtain the cookie of your Suno account

1. Head over to [suno.com/create](https://suno.com/create) using your browser.
2. Open up the browser console: hit `F12` or access the `Developer Tools`.
3. Navigate to the `Network` tab.
4. Give the page a quick refresh.
5. Identify the latest request that includes the keyword `?__clerk_api_version`.
6. Click on it and switch over to the `Header` tab.
7. Locate the `Cookie` section, hover your mouse over it, and copy the value of the Cookie.

![get cookie](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api/blob/main/public/get-cookie-demo.gif)

### 2. Register on 2Captcha and top up your balance
[2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/about) is a paid CAPTCHA solving service that uses real workers to solve the CAPTCHA and has high accuracy. It is needed because of Suno constantly requesting hCaptcha solving that currently isn't possible for free by any means.

[Create](https://2captcha.com/auth/register?userType=customer) a new 2Captcha account, [top up](https://2captcha.com/pay) your balance and [get your API key](https://2captcha.com/enterpage#recognition).

If you are located in Russia or Belarus, use the [ruCaptcha](https://rucaptcha.com) interface instead of 2Captcha. It's the same service, but it supports payments from those countries.

### 3. Clone and deploy this project

You can choose your preferred deployment method:

#### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgcui-art%2Fsuno-api&env=SUNO_COOKIE,TWOCAPTCHA_KEY,BROWSER,BROWSER_GHOST_CURSOR,BROWSER_LOCALE,BROWSER_HEADLESS&project-name=suno-api&repository-name=suno-api)

#### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api.git
cd suno-api
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```
#### Docker
Alternatively, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). However, follow the step below before running.

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up
```

### 4. Configure suno-api

- If deployed to Vercel, please add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

- If youâ€™re running this locally, be sure to add the following to your `.env` file:
#### Environment variables
- `SUNO_COOKIE` â€” the `Cookie` header you obtained in the first step.
- `TWOCAPTCHA_KEY` â€” your 2Captcha API key from the second step.
- `BROWSER` â€” the name of the browser that is going to be used to solve the CAPTCHA. Only `chromium` and `firefox` supported.
- `BROWSER_GHOST_CURSOR` â€” use ghost-cursor-playwright to simulate smooth mouse movements. Please note that it doesn't seem to make any difference in the rate of CAPTCHAs, so you can set it to `false`. Retained for future testing.
- `BROWSER_LOCALE` â€” the language of the browser. Using either `en` or `ru` is recommended, since those have the most workers on 2Captcha. [List of supported languages](https://2captcha.com/2captcha-api#language)
- `BROWSER_HEADLESS` â€” run the browser without the window. You probably want to set this to `true`.
```bash
SUNO_COOKIE=<â€¦>
TWOCAPTCHA_KEY=<â€¦>
BROWSER=chromium
BROWSER_GHOST_CURSOR=false
BROWSER_LOCALE=en
BROWSER_HEADLESS=true
```

### 6. Use Suno API

- `/api/concat`: Generate the whole song from extensions

You can also specify the cookies in the `Cookie` header of your request, overriding the default cookies in the `SUNO_COOKIE` environment variable. This comes in handy when, for example, you want to use multiple free accounts at the same time.
